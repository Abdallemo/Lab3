During this exercise, i created and analyzed three interconnected HTML pages for an e-commerce website: the Home page and the Product Categories page, and Product details.
The Home page features a header with the logo, search bar, buttons for login and account creation, a shopping cart button, 
and navigation bars. It includes an aside section for additional information and bestsellers, 
a main section with a promotional banner and latest products, and a footer with a copyright notice.
The Product Categories page includes a similar header with a navigation bar specific to product categories and a main section organized into categories such as CPU, 
Motherboard, GPU, Power Supply, and Monitors, each with links to specific products.
